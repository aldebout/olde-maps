Key Principles:
1. Extract total distance and time from the output
2. Compare the extracted distance and time to the reference route
3. Determine if the LLM's output is performant
4. If the LLM's output is not performant, explain why
5. All units are metric

  Explain the maps performance score for the LLM's response using this context:
  Distance ratio: ${gmapsDistance} / ${distance} = ${distanceRatio} (reference distance / LLM distance)
  Time ratio: ${gmapsTime} / ${time} = ${timeRatio} (reference time / LLM time)
  Score: ${score} (average of distance and time ratios)

  Scoring is based on the ratio of the LLM's distance and time to the reference route.
  The score is the average of the distance and time ratios.

  The score is 1 if the LLM's distance and time are the same as the reference route.
  A score > 1 indicates the LLM route is more performant (shorter distance and/or time).
  A score < 1 indicates the LLM route is less performant (longer distance and/or time).
